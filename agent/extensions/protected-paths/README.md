# protected-paths

Blocks `read`, `write`, and/or `edit` tool calls to protected paths. Each entry defines a path and an explicit ops denylist — so you can block writes to `node_modules/` while still allowing the agent to read it for docs and type references. The agent is told why it was blocked and recovers gracefully.

## How it works

On every `read`, `write`, or `edit` tool call, the extension checks the target path against the protected entries. Each entry has a `path` and an `ops` array (the denylist). If the path matches and the current operation is in that entry's `ops`, the call is blocked. Operations not listed in `ops` are allowed through.

Two matching strategies are used depending on the entry's `path` format:

**Bare entries** (e.g. `.env`, `node_modules/`)
The incoming path is split into segments and each one is compared exactly. This means `.env` matches a file literally named `.env` at any depth — `/project/.env`, `configs/.env`, `a/b/c/.env` — without false-positives like `.envrc` or `.environment`. Trailing slashes on directory entries are stripped before comparison.

**Absolute / home-relative entries** (e.g. `/etc/`, `~/.pi/agent/configs/`)
Both paths are resolved to absolute and a `startsWith` check is used. Any file nested inside the protected directory at any depth is blocked.

When a call is blocked, a warning notification is shown (if a UI is available) and the reason is sent back to the model so it can respond appropriately.

## Structure

```
protected-paths/
├── package.json
├── README.md
├── protected-paths.example.json
└── src/
    ├── config.ts  — PathEntry type, loadConfig(), built-in defaults
    └── index.ts   — matchesEntry(), getBlockedOps(), tool_call hook
```

## Default protected paths

These three entries apply when no config file is present:

| Path | Blocked ops | Rationale |
|------|-------------|-----------|
| `.env` | `read`, `write`, `edit` | Contains secrets — block everything |
| `.git/` | `read`, `write`, `edit` | Git internals — block everything |
| `node_modules/` | `write`, `edit` | Reads allowed (docs/types); writes blocked |

## Configuration

Copy the example config and edit it:

```bash
cp ~/.pi/agent/extensions/protected-paths/protected-paths.example.json \
   ~/.pi/agent/configs/protected-paths.json
```

```json
{
  "paths": [
    { "path": ".env",          "ops": ["read", "write", "edit"] },
    { "path": ".git/",         "ops": ["read", "write", "edit"] },
    { "path": "node_modules/", "ops": ["write", "edit"] }
  ]
}
```

- **`path`** — the file or directory to protect (see matching strategies below)
- **`ops`** — denylist of operations to block; any op not listed is allowed through. Valid values: `"read"`, `"write"`, `"edit"`

When the config file is present it **replaces** the defaults entirely — add the defaults back if you still want them.

### Matching strategies

| Path format | How it matches | Example |
|---|---|---|
| Bare name (`.env`) | Exact segment match at any path depth | Blocks `a/b/.env` but not `a/b/.envrc` |
| Bare directory (`node_modules/`) | Exact segment match on any path component | Blocks `a/node_modules/foo.js` at any depth |
| Absolute (`/etc/`) | Resolved `startsWith` — anything nested inside | Blocks all files under `/etc/` |
| Home-relative (`~/.pi/agent/configs/`) | Resolved `startsWith` — anything nested inside | Blocks all files under `~/.pi/agent/configs/` |

### Examples

```json
{
  "paths": [
    { "path": ".env",                    "ops": ["read", "write", "edit"] },
    { "path": ".git/",                   "ops": ["read", "write", "edit"] },
    { "path": "node_modules/",           "ops": ["write", "edit"] },
    { "path": "~/.pi/agent/configs/",   "ops": ["read", "write", "edit"] },
    { "path": "/etc/",                   "ops": ["write", "edit"] }
  ]
}
```
